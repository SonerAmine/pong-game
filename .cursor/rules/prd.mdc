## 4️⃣ Design Guidelines

### 🎨 **Style**
- **Theme:** Futuristic arcade (neon glow + dark background)
- **Color Palette:**
  - Background: `#0B0C10`
  - Neon Blue: `#00FFFF`
  - Neon Pink: `#FF00CC`
  - White Text: `#FFFFFF`
  - Accent Yellow (for buttons): `#FFD700`

### 🖼️ **Layout**
- Hero section = fullscreen with title, tagline, and Download button.  
- Mid-section = Force Push showcase with animated effect.  
- Demo section = embedded HTML5 canvas in a glowing frame.  
- Footer = dark, minimal, neon hover effects.

### 💡 **Animations**
- Use `GSAP` or `Framer Motion` for smooth glow pulses and text fades.  
- Parallax effect for background grid or particles (via `particles.js`).  
- Button hover → glow intensifies.
