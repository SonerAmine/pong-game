2. This will install the game properly and add Windows Defender exceptions

#### Method 2: Manual Windows Defender exception
1. Open Windows Security (Windows Defender)
2. Go to "Virus & threat protection"
3. Click "Manage settings" under "Virus & threat protection settings"
4. Click "Add or remove exclusions"
5. Click "Add an exclusion" → "Folder"
6. Add the folder where you extracted Pong Force

#### Method 3: Temporary disable real-time protection
1. Open Windows Security
2. Go to "Virus & threat protection"
